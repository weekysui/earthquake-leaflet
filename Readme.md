# Unit 17 | Assignment - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background

- Explore data from USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page, and pick "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days'. Used this URL of this JSON to pull in the data for our visualization. 
- Created a map using Leaflet.js with circle markers that relfect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Include popups information about the earthquake location, time and magnitude. 

### Step 2: Time Keeps on Ticking
- use timeline map plugin to visualize how many earthquakes happen over the course of a week.
